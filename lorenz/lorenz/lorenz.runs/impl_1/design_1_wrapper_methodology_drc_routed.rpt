There is a large setup violation of -9.259 ns between design_1_i/lorenz_hardware_0/inst/lorenz_hardware_struct/k1/srl_delay.synth_reg_srl_inst/partial_one.last_srlc33e/reg_array[1].fde_used.u2/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/lorenz_hardware_0/inst/lorenz_hardware_axi_lite_interface/inst/axi_rdata_reg[17]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
