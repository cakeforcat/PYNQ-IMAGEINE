## Introduction
This project aims to implement a partial differential equations (PDE) system approximation, using established methods like RK4, Heun, Verlet.
This is done to simulate and showcase the concept of [Strange Attractors](https://www.dynamicmath.xyz/strange-attractors/), which are a special case of PDE system.
